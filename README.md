A static analyzer that attempts to disprove the existence of data races in OpenMP programs. It uses ideas from Abstracting Abstract Machines, SP-bags, computation graphs, and other research.

It depends on pycparser 2.15 or later (2.15 added support for pragmas, which are essential to OpenMP). pycparser is available through standard package managers, including pip.
